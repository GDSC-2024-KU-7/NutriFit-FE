# Nutrifit
> Nutrifit is a healthcare app that helps users take nutrients evenly.

 Nutrifit is a combination of 'nutrition' and 'fit', conveying the meaning of assisting individuals in achieving personalized nutrient intake.
 
 Individuals have different recommended nutrient intake levels based on gender, age, height, and weight. It is difficult for an individual to know the recommended nutrient intake for his or her body, and even if he or she knows it, adhering to a diet that meets those requirements can be difficult. 
 
 This project aims to help individuals get more even nutrition through a system that calculates each individual's recommended nutrient and recommends food based on insufficient nutrients.
